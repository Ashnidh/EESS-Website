                    Taking into account the rigorous hard work required for getting into IIT, it is also understandable that the aspirants would also have gone through a phase of isolation, with the scale of it varying from person to person.Sacrificing so much and finally getting into an IIT, the freshers are launched directly into a land of opportunities.And right at the onset, their fears of being exposed to the public 's eyes and their judgment start creeping up and make them averse to the general idea of participation. And this is understandable since these opportunities require one to, bluntly put, "act like a grown-up." This is easier said than done, and only a few are able to walk the talk. When one is unable to do so, they feel disillusioned and alone. To make things worse, the interactions have reduced drastically for the 'COVID' batch, right at the initial stages of their public life.
